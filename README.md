\# 🐶 Dog Breed Identification using Deep Learning



\## 📌 Description

This project is a Deep Learning based web application that identifies dog breeds from uploaded images.  

The system uses Transfer Learning with a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify dog breeds with high accuracy.



The application allows users to upload an image and get the predicted dog breed along with confidence score.  

It also detects non-dog images and prevents incorrect predictions.
